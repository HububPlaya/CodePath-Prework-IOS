App Brainstorming
1. TikTok
  - the FYP is tailored to fit your interest while showing new areas to be discovered 
  - very diverse set of content and variety of niches 
2. Clash Royale
  - always coming up with new ways to make the game feel fresh
  - expands outside of troops and going toward decoration, tournaments, and new prizes
3. Apple Pay
  - Fits seamelessly into my iphone, and it was very easy to set up
  - The transfer feature is easier to access, and this makes things easier for the user 
4. spotify
  - ability to access artist, plsylist, albums, and new singles 
  - ability to find new music that fits what you like (shuffle)
5. cashapp
  - bank transfer is really nice to have and security has improved
  - The cash tag makes the experience of sending money on the spot quicker 

App Description: 
If I were to build my own app, it would probably be something that could clear tedious task away. SOmething like docusign where you can sign and send documents to another user, and they would count as real sign contract agreements. I think I would focus on using this as an email service for paperwork, so something with access to a google drive folder to send documents electronically to be signed. I would have to think through and reaserch the idea some more.
